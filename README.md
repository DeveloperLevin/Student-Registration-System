# Student Registration System

## Overview

This project implements a Student Registration System using Python, Tkinter for the GUI, and MySQL for the database backend. It allows users to register new students, search for existing student records based on various criteria, and display error messages for invalid inputs.

The initial design inspiration was taken from a YouTube tutorial by Shashank Saxena. However, significant modifications and enhancements were made to improve functionality and user experience.

## Technologies Used
